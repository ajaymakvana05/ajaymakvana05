## 👶 About Me

Hey there! I'm currently learning full-stack web development.  
I'm not an expert (yet 😎), but I'm passionate, curious, and always ready to break things in the name of learning.

### Here's where I'm at:
- 💻 Learning JavaScript, React, and Node.js
- 🎨 Building basic websites with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & Tailwind
- 🗃️ Exploring both SQL (MySQL + Sequelize) and NoSQL (MongoDB + Mongoose)
- 🧠 Trying to remember what I Googled yesterday
- 🐛 Debugging my own bugs... and sometimes creating new ones in the process
